I am a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at École de technologie supérieure (ETS). This fall semester, I teach two courses : *Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus* (MAT165) and *Differential equations* (MAT265).

I completed my PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of Université de Montréal. My thesis advisor is Anne Bourlioux. The subject of my thesis concerns the study of a new numerical coupled fire-atmosphere model for the propagation of wildfires.

I am co-organizer of the *Applications of Computer Algebra 2019* conference which will take place on the ETS campus in July 2019.
